# HMS
This project is about Hospital Management System based on C++. It was part of our Semester project So I thought it would be great to upload it here as well to help this community. This project uses Structure, Pointers, Arrays etc. but not Classes as we were told not to use Classes in our project.
My name is Hammad Hussain from Pakistan doing Bachelors in Software Engineering from Comsats University Islamabad.
